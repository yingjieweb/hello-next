This repo is created for learning Next.js

This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Conclusions ðŸ“’

Here are some conclusions I made while learning Next.js:

- Page File position is on behalf of its render route. If you want to create a page with '/posts/first-post', you should create a file named 'first-post.js' in the 'posts' folder. No routing libraries are required. [Learn more about routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing)

- `<Link>` tag from 'next/link' is used to create a link to another page. Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked page in the background. And the browser does not load the full page and client-side navigation is working. [Here is an example](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/client-side).
